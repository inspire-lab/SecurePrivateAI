    "# Poisoning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will be exploring data poisoning. Specifically backdoor poisoning. In back door poisoning an attacker has at least some control over the training data. Their goal is to place a marker in the data so that later at test time the system behaves in a certain way when it finds the marker.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case the desired behaviour is to predict a specific class that the attacker chooses at attack time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attack consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Create a marker/pattern\n",
    "2.   Embed the marker in the training data\n",
    "3.   Label all the marked data with the desired label\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you can find a code stub that you can use need to expand to create poisoned data and train a model on that data. Afterwards you need to perform some evaluation on the data. Design your experiments to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   How large does a marker need to be effective?\n",
    "2.   Does the opacity of the marker matter?\n",
    "3.   Does the \"design\" of the marker have any impact on success rate?\n",
    "4.   Are there good or bad marker placements? If so where are they? Can you think of a way to determine good placement?\n",
    "5.   Does the marker always need to be in the same place?\n",
    "6.   Do you need access to all classes during training? How many classes do you need access to?\n",
    "7.   Does the backdoor attack impact the model's performance on clean data?\n",
    "8.   Is the marker on its own effective? Do you need to modify valid instances? Think about training and test time?\n",

    "Change the runtime to GPU accelerated. Otherwise, you will be here for a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Select `Runtime` from the menu at the top\n",
    "2.   Click `Change Runtime type`\n",
    "3.   Under `Hardware accelerator` choose `GPU`\n",
    "4.   Hit `Save` and if it is asks you to reconnect do so\n",
